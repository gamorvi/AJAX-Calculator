AJAX-Calculator
===============

A simple calculator just like the one you will find on your windows pc or apple mac but in the browser. 
Using AJAX for transport and app main logic in PHP. Only 2 files.

This calculator mimics everything your pc or mac calculator will do.

1. index.php holds the interface and controlls of the calculator (uses jquery AJAX to send click events to 2. ajax.php)

2. ajax.php contains the logic that checks input to ensure all calculations are correct. Very basic logic but very powerful

Whip this code in 2 hours there are two features missing, if you want to get your hands a bit dirty you can complete them.

Current Features Not Present
-------------------------------
a. Recognise decimal numbers and stop adding extra dots
b. Recognise a negative number and and use it in a calculation
